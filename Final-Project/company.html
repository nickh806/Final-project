          <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
          <p>Nintendo's mission is to put smiles on the faces of everyone we touch. We do so by creating new surprises for people across the world to enjoy together.</p>
           <p>   We've forged our own path since 1889, when we began making hanafuda playing cards in Kyoto, Japan. Today, we're fortunate to be able to share our characters, ideas and worlds through the medium of video games and the entertainment industry.</p>
          <p>Nintendo of America, established in 1980 and based in Redmond, Wash., is a wholly owned subsidiary of Nintendo Co., Ltd.
              We are committed to delivering best-in-class products and services to our customers and to investing in the well-being of our employees as part of the global Nintendo family.</p>
